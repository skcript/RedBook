### Vacation and Leaves

We understand that taking time off from work, and recharging yourself is very critical to do the most challenging work at Skcript. So you are free to take an off under these circumstances, in addition to the recognized [list of holidays](https://github.com/skcript/BlackBook/blob/master/Perks/Holidays.md).

As a full-time team member of Skcript, you are free to take 3 weeks (15 days) of paid vacation every year that calculates to 1.25 of a day per month of work. But to make sure the business runs even during your vacation, you are required to schedule your vacation a week in advance, and get it approved from the founding team of Skcript. Once approved, we will communicate with the entire team.

Everyone also accrue **1 hour of sick leave for every 30 hours** of work, but cannot accrue more than 5 days of sick leave.

Team members should report vacation and sick days to the founder they report to, who will mark it in the payroll system (which keeps track of accrued days and should include them on every pay stub).

Team members with chronic or terminal illnesses should talk with the founder they report to about their needs for remote work, flexible time, disability leave and/or other support.

Being a small team, any unannounced leave will hurt the business of the company, which in turn goes against the growth of the company, and will not be tolerated.
