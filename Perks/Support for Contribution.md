### Support for Contribution

Skcript truly believes in contributing to the community in any form that would help other people. So we understand that it’s important to support our teams’ efforts to contribute, learn, grow and improve the community. These are some of the key benefits of working at Skcript, and following its culture.

#### Learning Budget

Every employee has a company budget to support any learning activity that they want to pursue related to the product they are currently working on at Skcript. Each employee has an annual budget of Rs. 6,000 which can be spent towards program fees/tuition, tickets, flights, and hotels for industry conferences, classes, mentorship programs, books, programs, videos, or other places that they feel will provide valuable learning experiences. These expenses should be discussed in one-on-ones and approved by the CEO. This budget resets at the beginning of every calendar year and does not roll over. The learning budget will be limited to Rs. 3,000 during the first year of implementation and for employees joining the company after the month of March in the calendar year. The budget varies based on the years of experience at Skcript, and the importance of the course.

Employees can also use work hours to work on learning projects, though this should be limited to four hours a week.

#### Speaking Budget

Skcript was built around a community our founders built in the city. We constantly encourage you to not only attend, but also to speak at conferences and share your knowledge with others in the industry. We would love to support anyone who’s been invited to speak at a conference/event, and the company will sponsor the flight tickets and stay if the organizers are not sponsoring it. But this could vary depending on the size of the conference, relevance to our area of interest and your work load.

Everyone at Skcript are eligible **once a quarter** or **4 times a year**. Prior approval with important information about the conference/event is necessary and the tickets will be booked by the company for you. 

Speaking budget will be limited to two events during the first year of implementation and for employees joining the company after the month of March in the calendar year.
